Fitness tracker application made for Wear OS; 
made in Jetpack Compose using Google Health Services to control the device sensors as well as the Wearable API to send data to the user's phone
Current version doesn't have proper permission requests so manually giving the app permits is the only way to make it run.(will be fixed soon)
